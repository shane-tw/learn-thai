This project aims firstly to be a responsive web-based clone of [this Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tfe.mobilesoft.learn.thaialphabet).  
The goal is to then add extra features on top of it, for example:
* Having a number show up in Thai, and requiring the user to type the number in English.
* Allow configuration for quizzes, such as:
  - Hide images to make recognition trickier.
  - Randomise fonts between looped and loopless variants, to match real world usage.
* A tone quiz for consonants
